## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Please select a destination" error
**Solution:** Make sure you click on a destination from the search results, not just search.

### Problem: No flights showing up
**Solution:** 
- Check that you entered valid airport codes
- Ensure trip dates are set in Step 1
- Try different airport codes (e.g., "MNL" instead of "Manila")

### Problem: Weather not loading
**Solution:** 
- Weather loads automatically when you select a destination
- If it fails, the itinerary will still be created without weather data

### Problem: Print button not working
